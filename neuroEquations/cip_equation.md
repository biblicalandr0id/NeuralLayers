I. Combined Input Processing (CIP):
CIP(t) = {
    Sensory: Σ(t) = ∑[s∈S] ∫[0→t] λₛ(τ) × [∏(i=1→5) ψᵢ(s,τ)] dτ
    Logical: Ψ = ∑(λᵢ × ξᵢ)
    
    Where:
    λₛ = Sensory weights
    λᵢ = Reasoning weights in cognitive space
    ξᵢ = Logical premises in vector form
    i ∈ {1...n} premises
}
