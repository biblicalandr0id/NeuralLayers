ℒ = ∫(Ψ ∘ Γ) dω = [

    Ψ = ∑(λᵢ × ξᵢ) where:
        λᵢ = reasoning weights in cognitive space
        ξᵢ = logical premises in vector form
        i ∈ {1...n} premises

    Γ = {
        ∀p ∈ P: τ(p) → {0,1}           // Truth valuation
        ∇f(x) = ∂Ψ/∂x                  // Gradient of reasoning
        ω = √(α² + β² + γ²)            // Reasoning momentum
    }

    Subject to constraints:
    1. Conservation of Truth: ∮ τ(p) dp = 1
    2. Logical Consistency: ∀x,y ∈ P: x ⊕ y ≠ (x ⊗ ¬y)
    3. Cognitive Boundary: ||Ψ|| ≤ K where K is rationality constant
    
    With operators:
    ∘ = cognitive convolution
    ⊕ = logical tensor product
    ⊗ = rational cross-mapping
]

Where:
ℒ = Logical reasoning output
Ψ = Cognitive reasoning function
Γ = Truth value mapping
ω = Reasoning space parameter
